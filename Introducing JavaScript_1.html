        <li>
           PH:
          <ul>
             <li>Concrete pools - check that the PH is within the range of 7.2 to 7.6</li>
             <li>Fibreglass pools - less tolerant of PH variation and alkalinity - check that the PH reading falls between 7.0 and 7.2</li>
             <li>Check for possible interference - heavy downpours of rain, water replacement, heavy use of pool, introduction of chemicals that could upset PH</li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
           Calcium Hardness:
           <ul>
             <li>Check that the calcium level falls between 250-350 ppm</li>
             <li>Check for corrosion of metal parts or staining of pool </li>
             <li>Check for calcium build-up on filters and pipes, and cloudiness of water</li>
           </ul>
         </li>
